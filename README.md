For this assignment I was able to upload the code as files into the repository, but I could not find the outputs of the code or properly import the dataset from the class OneDrive. Because of this, I couldn’t see the tables or obtain information about the dataset, and therefore was unable to answer any of the homework questions. I spent multiple hours working with the VS code interface and seeing how changes in the repository on VS code can be organized and transferred to Github. To begin the assignment, I downloaded the zip files of the Medicare Advantage data onto my computer and successfully imported the data directly into the repository in VS code. I also imported the code that cleans the dataset for use in questions 1-5 in a separate file in the repository. I was able to commit these changes, but when I tried to push them to Github, it said that the file size of the monthly-ma-and-pdp-enrollment-by-cpsc.zip was too large for Github and that I couldn’t push any of my changes. I do not know how to use data files in VS code without uploading the entire file directly into the repository so that it has to be pushed to Github. Because of this, I can not save a PDF copy of work that includes the data set, and have instead included in this PDF only the data cleaning code and this description of my work. My goal for the next submission is to learn where I can find the outputs of my code, and how to import data in a way that is compatible with Github uploading.
